# matrixriddle
My chemistry teacher gave us a matrix riddle, this script brute forces the correct answer
The riddle:
- using the numbers 1-9 (using each number ONCE), place them in a 3x3 table so that all vertical, horizontal, and diagonal lines through any part of the 3x3 will add up to the same number. All squares must be occupied.
The answer (don't read if you want to try the riddle yourself):
- after putting the attempts tried to 100000 for the first time, the program returned:
- "Attempt no.72554
   Answer:
	  [6, 1, 8]
	  [7, 5, 3]
	  [2, 9, 4]"
