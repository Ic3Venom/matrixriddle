# matrixriddle
My chemistry teacher gave us a matrix riddle, this script brute forces the correct answer
The riddle:
- using the numbers 1-9 (using each number ONCE), place them in a 3x3 table so that all vertical, horizontal, and diagonal lines through any part of the 3x3 will add up to the same number. All squares must be occupied.
